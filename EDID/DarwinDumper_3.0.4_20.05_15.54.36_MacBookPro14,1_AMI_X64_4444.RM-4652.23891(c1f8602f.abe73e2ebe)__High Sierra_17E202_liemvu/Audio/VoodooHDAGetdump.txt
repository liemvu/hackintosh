VoodooHDA's getdump tool failed to produce a dump.
NOTE: AppleHDA was loaded when this dump was attempted.
If you wish to get a successful dump using VoodooHDA and it's associated getdump tool then AppleHDA will have to be disabled.
The simplest option to do that will be to add AppleHDADisabler.kext to your system, rebuild caches and reboot. Then try this dump again.
